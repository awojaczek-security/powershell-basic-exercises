## 📸 Information and photos from the analysis of the Incident:

The alert was generated on **Jun, 21, 2023, 01:51 PM**.
This alert describes an event detected as a potential brute force attack on a VPN service. Multiple failed login attempts to various user accounts were recorded from a single IP address. After a series of failed attempts, a successful login to the account *mane@letsdefend.io*. This pattern of activity is characteristic of a password guessing attack. The event indicates a high risk of user account takeover. The incident requires further analysis of post-login activity and security measures such as password reset and source IP address verification.

A reputation check in VirusTotal showed no malicious activity associated with the source IP address 37.19.221.229. All security vendors reported 0 detections, indicating no known malicious reputation at the time of analysis.

This address originates from the United States.

Additionally, we verify this information in the AbuseIPDB database.
The IP address **37.19.221.229** has been reported 64 times in **AbuseIPDB** by various entities. The current risk level (*Confidence of Abuse 11%*) is relatively low. The last report appeared a week ago, so the activity is quite recent. The address belongs to a hosting company (*Datacamp Limited (AS212238*)), i.e., a server in a data center, and not to a regular home user. In the past, it has been linked to brute force attempts, port scanning, website attacks, and other automated activity. This means that this address has a suspicious history and should not be ignored.

The next step is to verify the log management information. Many entries were found, and their dates and times are very close to the data contained in the alert.

Analysis of detailed logs revealed numerous failed attempts to log into the **VPN network** from a single IP address. The attacker tried using multiple usernames until the correct account was identified (*mane@letsdefend.io*). After a series of unsuccessful attempts, a successful login to this account was recorded. This pattern of activity is characteristic of a *brute force* and may indicate that credentials have been compromised.

In the next stage, Mane's activity in the Endpoint Security system was verified to check whether any suspicious processes, unusual network connections, or commands had been executed after the incident.
The analysis showed that after the alert was generated, i.e., after successfully logging into the **VPN**, no suspicious system activity was recorded.

It was also noted that the IP address of the end system differs from the destination address indicated in the logs (**33.33.33.33**). This is due to the fact that **33.33.33.33** is the public address of the **VPN gateway**, while after establishing a connection, the user receives an internal IP address within the company network.
